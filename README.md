### 👋 Hi there! 

I'm Paul Aigbokhai Olukayode, a passionate technologist hailing from Lagos, Nigeria. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in the same field, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, I bring a unique blend of academic prowess and practical experience to the table. My journey began in the banking sector, where I specialized in database engineering, and continued as a Sales Technology Strategist in a distribution company. This diverse background has equipped me with a range of technical expertise and strategic planning skills.

My passion for technology has led me to specialize in Artificial Intelligence, where I'm dedicated to exploring the frontiers of innovation through coding and strategic thinking. Currently, I'm building a startup company that focuses on AI, software, hardware, media, space, and robotics. This venture embodies my vision of merging cutting-edge technology with strategic foresight to drive impactful change and revolutionize various sectors. I'm excited to collaborate and contribute to transformative projects that redefine the possibilities of tomorrow!🚀
